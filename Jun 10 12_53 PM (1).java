ALL A company's HR department needs an SQL query against data from a freelance hiring platform.
The result should have the following columns: first_name | last_name | email | job_success_score. 
It should be sorted in descending order by job_success_score, then in ascending order by first_name and last_name. 
Limit the result to the first ten records. 

Note: Only profiles that have a "JSS" (Job Success Score) greater than 90 should be included. 
4 Only those profiles that have passed the verification process (is_verified is 1) should be included.

Here's the SQL query that satisfies all the given conditions:
sql
Copy code

SELECT 
    first_name,
    last_name,
    email,
    job_success_score
FROM 
    freelance_profiles
WHERE 
    job_success_score > 90
    AND is_verified = 1
ORDER BY 
    job_success_score DESC,
    first_name ASC,
    last_name ASC
LIMIT 10;


Explanation:
WHERE job_success_score > 90 filters for profiles with JSS > 90.
AND is_verified = 1 ensures only verified profiles are included.
ORDER BY job_success_score DESC sorts primarily by highest JSS.
first_name ASC, last_name ASC gives alphabetical order within equal JSS.
LIMIT 10 restricts output to the top 10 records.
Let me know if your table name is different or if you need joins from multiple tables.

Thanks! Since the Job Success Score (JSS) is in a separate table, youâ€™ll need to use a JOIN to fetch the job_success_score along with other details like first_name, last_name, email, and is_verified.
Assuming the table structures are:
freelance_profiles:
id (primary key)
first_name
last_name
email
is_verified
job_success_scores:
profile_id (foreign key referencing freelance_profiles.id)
job_success_score
Hereâ€™s the SQL query using a JOIN:
sql
Copy code


SELECT 
    fp.first_name,
    fp.last_name,
    fp.email,
    jss.job_success_score
FROM 
    freelance_profiles fp
JOIN 
    job_success_scores jss
    ON fp.id = jss.profile_id
WHERE 
    jss.job_success_score > 90
    AND fp.is_verified = 1
ORDER BY 
    jss.job_success_score DESC,
    fp.first_name ASC,
    fp.last_name ASC
 LIMIT 10;	


Summary:
We join freelance_profiles with job_success_scores on profile ID.
We filter by job_success_score > 90 and is_verified = 1.
We sort and limit the result as required.
Let me know if the table or column names differ â€” Iâ€™ll adjust accordingly.

ALL Write a class StudentRank with two member variables named students, a string array, and ranks, an integer array. Add a method, highest Rank, that returns the highest-ranked student. Also, write a lowestRank method which provides the name of the lowest-ranked student.

Hereâ€™s the Java class StudentRank that fulfills your requirements:
âœ… Java Code:
java


Copy code
public class StudentRank {
    private String[] students;
    private int[] ranks;
 
    // Constructorpublic StudentRank(String[] students, int[] ranks) {
        this.students = students;
        this.ranks = ranks;
    }
 
    // Method to get student with highest rank (lowest number)public String highestRank() {
        int minIndex = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < ranks.length; i++) {
            if (ranks[i] < ranks[minIndex]) {
                minIndex = i;
            }
        }
        return students[minIndex];
    }
 
    // Method to get student with lowest rank (highest number)public String lowestRank() {
        int maxIndex = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < ranks.length; i++) {
            if (ranks[i] > ranks[maxIndex]) {
                maxIndex = i;
            }
        }
        return students[maxIndex];
    }
 
    // For testingpublic static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] students = {"Taylor", "Wesley", "Jordan"};
        int[] ranks = {1, 5, 3};
 
        StudentRank sr = new StudentRank(students, ranks);
 
        System.out.println("Highest Rank: " + sr.highestRank()); // Taylor
 
    }
}


ðŸ“Œ Sample Output:
Given:
java
Copy code
String[] students = {"Taylor", "Wesley", "Jordan"};
int[] ranks = {1, 5, 3};
highestRank() â†’ returns "Taylor"
lowestRank() â†’ returns "Wesley"
Let me know if you need this in another language like Python or want to return the index or rank instead of the name.
